If this condition is True, the break statement is run ❹, and the execution moves out of the loop to print('Thank you!') ❺. Otherwise, the if statement’s clause with the break statement is skipped, which puts the execution at the end of the while loop. At this point, the program execution jumps back to the start of the while statement ❶ to recheck the condition. Since this condition is merely the True Boolean value, the execution enters the loop to ask the user to type your name again."
